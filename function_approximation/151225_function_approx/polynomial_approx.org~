Here is a possible polynomial in 4 variables x= (x_1,...x_4)

w_1 is also a vector with 6 components w_1= 1/2, -1/3, +0.25, -1

w_2 is something similar



Polynomial is  (0.3(\scal(w_1}{x} + scal{w_2}{x})^2 - 0.75
(\scal(w_3}{x} + scal{w_4}{x})^2)^2

this is sparse not in monomials but in terms like \scal(w_1}{x}

this is a quadratic function on a binary tree
